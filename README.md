# 3D Model of Residential Building using Autodesk Revit
🏡 3D Residential Building Model — Autodesk Revit
    This project features a detailed 3D model of a residential building created using Autodesk Revit. The model showcases fundamental architectural design elements and BIM (Building Information Modeling) practices,     suitable for presentation in academic portfolios and internship applications.

🔧 Project Highlights:
  • Developed a complete 3D model of a multi-storey residential building with realistic architectural elements.

  • Incorporated structural components, walls, floors, windows, doors, roofing, and staircases.

  • Implemented Revit families and used View Templates to manage visual styles and documentation.

  • Created 2D plans, sections, elevations, and rendered views from the 3D model for presentation purposes.

  • Applied BIM methodology to simulate building performance and ensure accurate geometry.

📁 Tools & Technologies:
  • Autodesk Revit (BIM modeling)

  • Revit Family Editor

  • Sheets & Annotations

  • Rendering Tools (native Revit renderer or Enscape/Lumion if applicable)

📌 Purpose:
    This project was developed as part of a learning initiative/internship application to demonstrate proficiency in architectural modeling and Revit-based workflows.
